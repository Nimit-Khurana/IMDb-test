POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE STARTING A PYTHON PROJECT--

You need to create templates and static folders in your project folder, put all .html files in templates folder and all other files (CSS, JS, JPG, etc) in static folder and then in your html
file use url_for to load the static files, instead of the default HTML way.
i.e bootstrap looks into templates folder for user templates 'by default' and in static folder for all other files.
* Here in this project-->
-imdb
    flaskk.py
    script.py
    venv/
    - templates
        |strap.html
    -static
        -css
          |style.css
        -js
          |example.js
        -img 
          |example.jpg

Know AJAX--
AJAX is a technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used.
With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.
Ajax is a technique for creating interactive web applications.

jquery and flask (link="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp")
	With the jQuery AJAX methods, you can request text, HTML, XML, or JSON from a remote server using both HTTP Get and HTTP Post - And you can load the external data directly into the
		selected HTML elements of your web page!
	jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an 
	easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
