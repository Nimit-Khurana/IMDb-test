POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE STARTING A PYTHON PROJECT--

You need to create templates and static folders in your project folder, put all .html files in templates folder and all other files (CSS, JS, JPG, etc) in static folder and then in your html
file use url_for to load the static files, instead of the default HTML way.
i.e bootstrap looks into templates folder for user templates 'by default' and in static folder for all other files.
* Here in this project-->

-imdb
    flaskk.py
    script.py
    venv/
    - templates
        strap.html
    -static
        -css
          style.css
        -js
          example.js
        -img 
          example.jpg
